# Power Platform Samples
This repository contains Power Platform samples and templates that I share with the community, mainly centered around Governance.
Most of these samples and templates come with a related article in my blog https://powertricks.io.
This blog is a very recent initiative... Hence the low amount of content at this stage :)
You will find:
- [DLP Policy Toolbox](https://github.com/ValentinMaz/Power-Platform-Samples/tree/main/DLP%20Policy%20Toolbox): a free solution to enable admins to quickly duplicate existing DLP Policies and identify which DLP Policies apply to a specific envrionment (no need for managed environments...)
- [Ownership Toolbox](https://github.com/ValentinMaz/Power-Platform-Samples/tree/main/Ownership%20Toolbox): another free solution for tenant admin to manage Apps and Flows ownership in bulk in a few clicks - it does require to be installed on an environment where the CoE Kit is installed
- [Power BI Templates](https://github.com/ValentinMaz/Power-Platform-Samples/tree/main/PowerBI%20Templates): a serie of Power BI templates which can be used to extend the CoE Kit and gain additional insights on things such as API Calls and AI Builder
