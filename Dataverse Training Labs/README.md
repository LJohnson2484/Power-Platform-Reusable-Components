# Dataverse Training Labs
These **Dataverse Training Labs** contain step-by-step instructions to learn about and practice with Dataverse. More information about Dataverse and the reasons why I created these labs can be found on this blog post: https://powertricks.io/dataverse-labs

## What you will find in this repo
- **A Note for Admins**: This document is intended for Power Platform CoEs and Admins. I provide information about the technical requirement to follow the Labs there. The main question will be to define the Environment which will be used to complete the labs, for which I share some ideas.
- [**The PowerTricks Dataverse Labs**](https://github.com/ValentinMaz/Power-Platform-Samples/raw/main/Dataverse%20Training%20Labs/PowerTricks%20Dataverse%20Labs.pdf): The actual step-by-step instructions to follow to complete the Labs. This has been as detailed as possible with screenshots and annotation.
- [**Lab Materials**](Labs%20Materials/): this contains a solution package and some import csv files which are required to follow the first chapter of the labs.
- [**Editable Files**](Editable%20Files/): the Note for Admins and Labs in the .docx format if you wish to adjust and re-brand them. 

## What you will learn with the Labs
The Labs are based on the Accident Tracking Leaning Path from Microsoft Learn. It has been enhanced and updated to cover more Dataverse functionalities. Throughout these labs, you will:
- Import a Managed Solution to explore the final solution which you will then build step by step from scratch,
- Create a Solution with Dataverse tables and relationships. You will work with many differnt types of column,
- Create a Model Driven App. For this you will create different forms, views, and business rules,
- Extend the Model Driven App. You will then add a custom page with a Canvas App to extend the Model Driven App, as well as a business process flows and charts to further improve user experience,
- Manage the Security of the App. You will create a Security Role to manage the access to the App and turn on Auditing for better monitoring,
- Finish by further extending the solution by automating a notification process with Power Automate and reporting on the data from Power BI.
